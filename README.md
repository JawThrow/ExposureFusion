## ExposureFusion
### Introduction

This is the implementation of Exposure fusion algorithm ('Exposure fusion' In proceedings of Pacific Graphics 2007).
I coded this algorithm on my own using OpenCV and C++.
If you have any theoretical question about Exposure fusion, i recommend you to read the paper or contact author.

Since I'm not a professional but just a student who love image processing,
I approve that there are some mistakes and unefficiency in my code.
I always welcome your feedback.

I will add description and some figures of Exposure fusion soon.
