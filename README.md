# ExposureFusion
This is the implementation of Exposure fusion algorithm ('Exposure fusion' In proceedings of Pacific Graphics 2007).

I coded this algorithm on my own using OpenCV and C++.

If you any theoretical question about Exposure fusion, i recommend you to read the paper or contact author.

Since I'm not a professional and approve that there are some mistakes and unefficiency in my code.

I always welcome your feedback.

I will add description and some figures of Exposure fusion soon.
